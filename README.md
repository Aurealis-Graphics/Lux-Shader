# The Lux Shader

A Minecraft shader heavily based on the [BSL Shaders by Capt Tatsu](https://bitslablab.com "Takes you to the BSL Website") (v7.1.05), adding quality of life additions and tweaks. While trying to be aestheticly pleasing, the shader tries to be as gameplay-friendly as possible.

## Features
* Auroras
* Chromatic Abberation
* New Water Waves
* Better Bloom
* Different Tonemapping
* Shooting Stars
* Adjusted Clouds
* Underwater Color Grading
* And many more...

## What's to come
There are still a lot of features i have in mind. I will generally modify the shader where I think it would improve performance or just look good.
