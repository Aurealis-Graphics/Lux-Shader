# The Lux Shader

A minecraft shader heavily based on the [BSL Shaders by Capt Tatsu](https://bitslablab.com "Takes you to the BSL Website") (v7.1.05), adding quality of life additions and tweaks. While trying to be aestheticly pleasing, the shader tries to be as gameplay-friendly as possible.

## What's to come
There are still a lot of features i have in mind. I will generally modify the shader where I think it would improve performance or just look good.
